This project began because I couldn't stand the the two permission errors that Sudocab kept returning every time I'd open a new terminal. From there, I've decided to work on making this plugin a tad more extensible. My hope is to enable you to upload your own dictionary files so you can learn whatever language you prefer.

## Install
#### English
```bash
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abourass/sudoCab/master/script.sh | bash
chmod +x ~/.vocab
```

#### German
```bash
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abourass/sudoCab/master/german-script.sh | bash
chmod +x ~/.vocab-german
```

Now restart your terminal! You should now start receiving some top notch vocab.
